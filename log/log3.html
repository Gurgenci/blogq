<p>X=True; Input :What are typical electrolyser efficiencies?</p>
<p>Find 3 docs closest to the expanded text:
Typical electrolyser efficiencies vary depending on the type of electrolysis technology, stack design, and operating conditions. In general, alkaline electrolyzers, which are widely used for industrial-scale hydrogen production, typically operate at an efficiency of around 70-80%. Proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers, commonly used in fuel cell applications, can achieve efficiencies ranging from 60% to 90%, while solid oxide electrolyzers (SOEs), often employed in power-to-gas and chemical synthesis, can reach efficiencies of up to 95%. Other types of electrolyzers, such as anion exchange membrane (AEM) and liquid junction electrolyzers, may have slightly lower efficiencies. Overall, the efficiency of an electrolyzer is influenced by factors like current density, operating temperature, and gas purity, making it important to consider these variables when selecting or designing an electrolysis system.</p>

<p>Find 3 docs closest to the expanded text:
The Fermi Paradox, also known as the Great Filter, is a philosophical and scientific conundrum that questions why we have not yet observed any signs of intelligent extraterrestrial life. The paradox is named after physicist Enrico Fermi, who famously asked &quot;Where is everybody?&quot; during a lunchtime conversation at Los Alamos National Laboratory in the 1950s. The paradox arises from the fact that with an estimated 100-400 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy alone, and the likelihood of at least some of these stars having planets in their habitable zones, one would expect to see some sign of intelligent life, such as radio signals or other evidence of technology. However, despite decades of searching, we have found no conclusive evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence. This has led scientists and philosophers to ponder the possibility that advanced civilizations may self-destruct before they are able to communicate with us, or that there is a significant barrier preventing them from becoming detectable, leading to the paradoxical silence from the universe.</p>

<li><code>According to the text, if we're living in a simulation, the answer to the Fermi Paradox (where are these intelligent aliens?) might be tied to the limitations of computational power in our simulation tier. Our simulated universe might only be designed to support one intelligent species: us. Those billions of galaxies we see through telescopes could be nothing more than a façade, and the speed of light may have been imposed as a hard limit to prevent us from traveling to distant stars and uncovering the illusion.</code></li>

<p>Find 3 docs closest to the expanded text:
The Fermi Paradox, also known as the Great Silence, is a philosophical and scientific conundrum that asks, &quot;Where is everybody?&quot; Specifically, it queries why we have not yet observed any signs of intelligent extraterrestrial life, despite the high probability of its existence. The paradox is named after physicist Enrico Fermi, who famously asked this question during a lunchtime conversation at Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1950. Fermi's colleagues were discussing the possibility of extraterrestrial civilizations, and he wondered aloud why we had not yet seen any evidence of them, given the vast number of stars with potentially habitable planets and the long period of time that has passed since the emergence of life on Earth. The paradox highlights the discrepancy between our expectation of encountering other intelligent life forms and the complete lack of evidence to support this notion.</p>

<p>X=True; Ref=0. Input :What is the cost of sending 1 kg to the orbit?</p>
<p>Find 3 docs closest to the expanded text:
The cost of sending 1 kilogram (2.2 pounds) to orbit can vary greatly depending on the specific launch vehicle, mission requirements, and orbit desired. Generally speaking, the cost can range from around $10,000 to over $50,000 per kilogram. For example, a commercial satellite launch on a Falcon 9 rocket might cost around $20,000 to $30,000 per kilogram to send it into low Earth orbit (LEO). In contrast, sending cargo to the International Space Station (ISS) using SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft costs around $10,000 to $15,000 per kilogram. More complex missions, such as sending a payload to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) or interplanetary trajectories, can cost significantly more, upwards of $50,000 to over $100,000 per kilogram.</p>
